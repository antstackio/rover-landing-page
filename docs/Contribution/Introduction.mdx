# Introduction


Rover is an NPM package which helps us in generating/updating AWS SAM projects with help of predefined Modules and Components. It also helps us in deploying projects by generating CI/CD pipeline or directly deploy through CLI.

Modules are the small business units of an application which are reusable, like authentication, CRUD APIs etc.

Components are one or more infrastructure units like Lambda, S3 or a combination of them like API Gateway + Lambda + S3.

And for deployment Rover supports 2 features , one we can generate our own CI/CD pipeline or we can directly deploy through CLI.
Rover presently supports CI/CD pipeline generation of following three services:
* GitHub
* BitBucket
* GitLabs
